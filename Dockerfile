# Copied from baseline-ops/templates/Dockerfile. It builds any application that
# follows the engineering baseline: one static Go binary, assets embedded,
# ./cmd/server as the main package. Change nothing per project — if a project
# needs a different image, the project is wrong or this template is.

# The build stage is pinned to the build platform and asks Go for the target
# architecture. On the server both are the same, so nothing cross-compiles; the
# form is kept so the same file also builds on an arm64 laptop without QEMU
# emulating the whole toolchain.
FROM --platform=$BUILDPLATFORM golang:1.26-alpine AS build

# git is not a dependency of the code. The toolchain shells out to it to read
# the VCS metadata that stamps info.Main.Version — and golang:alpine ships no
# git. Without this line the build carries none, and the baseline's canonical
# reader falls through to a per-boot id: /healthz answers a different string
# after every restart, and the immutable static assets are re-downloaded with
# it. Silent either way — nothing fails, the answer to "what is running?" goes.
